	With the widespread engineering applications ranging from broadband signals and non-linear systems, time-domain integral equations (TDIE) methods for analyzing transient electromagnetic scattering problems are becoming widely used nowadays. TDIE-based marching-on-in-time (MOT) scheme and its fast algorithm are researched in this dissertation, including the numerical techniques of MOT scheme, late-time stability of MOT scheme, and two-level PWTD-enhanced MOT scheme. The contents are divided into four parts shown as follows.
	
	
	Aiming at these problems, the thesis focuses on XXXXXX, and achieves the following research results:	
	\begin{enumerate}[labelsep = .5em, leftmargin = 0pt, itemindent = 3.8em]
	\item[(1)] 
	Descriptions on result 1.
	\item[(2)] 
	Description on result 2.
	\item[(3)] 
	Description on result 3.
	\end{enumerate}
